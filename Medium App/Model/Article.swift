  "I once built a Thanos browser extension, clicking on it made 50% of your tabs disappear :D. It’s very helpful when I have too many tabs open. These simple projects helped me apply my coding skills and learn a lot than the usual competitive coding. I plan on writing another article to elaborate on my one-year of coding strategies.",
  "Build an awesome resume and apply online on the careers website! I have had several people DM me about how unfortunate it is that Facebook doesn’t come to their college, that’s okay! You can always apply online, they do go through your resume and select you if they find you a good fit, I promise. That’s how they got back to me!",
  "Practice, practice, practice! They ask questions about data structures and algorithms, and I asked a few Facebook engineers how this works. Turns out they have a database with tons of interview questions, and your interviewer picks any random question to ask you.",
  "Technical interview: This takes place online, and is about 60–75 minutes long. You are given a link to an online collaborative editor, where you code while talking to your interviewer. During the first 15 minutes, your interviewer goes through your resume and asks you about your projects and career. The next 60 minutes are spent solving 2 coding questions. The first question is generally easier. The last 5 minutes are for you to ask them any questions you may have about life at Facebook.",
  "Onsite interview: This can also happen online instead of onsite depending on your location and the circumstances. If your interview is onsite, have fun! You’ll get a tour of Facebook’s headquarters and talk and network with a lot of people. Mine was online though, so I can’t elaborate further.",
  "The optional third interview: This doesn’t usually happen unless the interviewers are really unsure whether they want to accept you or reject you. If it does happen, it’s the same level of difficulty as the second one.",
  "Difficulty wise I would say they ask Hackerrank/Leetcode medium and hard questions. I had a lot of people ask me about where to practice from, my answer is, do whatever suits you! You can use Hackerrank, HackerEarth, CodeForces, Codechef, Leetcode, etc. I used Hackerrank and Leetcode a lot. Working on tons of projects helps too, I used to do really weird projects on weekends.",
